# customer-segmentation-colab
This project explores customer segmentation for an online streaming service using user data. We'll analyze viewing habits and preferences to group users into distinct clusters and then leverage those insights for targeted marketing strategies.
The code performs basic customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. It analyzes features like watch time, number of movies watched, and unique genres to group users. We can then explore these clusters further to understand their viewing habits and preferences.
